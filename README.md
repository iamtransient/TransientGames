# Transient Mini Games

A collection of lightweight, single-file browser games built under the **Transient** brand — signature deep-space aesthetic with neon cyan/magenta accents, glassmorphism, and zero-dependency HTML.

No build step. No installs. Every game is one `.html` file you can open directly in a browser.
